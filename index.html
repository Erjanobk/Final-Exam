                    side of the country and it's known as the Venice of the north due to its large number of canals. Amsterdam became 
                    one of the most important ports in the world in the 17th century and became the leading center of finance and trade.
                     The city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands. Many Dutch companies have their headquarters there such as  Philips,
                    AkzoNobel, TomTom, and ING. Also, many of the world's largest companies are based in Amsterdam or have established their
                    European headquarters in the city, such as leading technology companies Uber, Netflix and Tesla.[18] In 2012, Amsterdam

            </h1>

            <p>
                    Bos en Lommer neighborhood got its name after a farm named Forest of Shade that used to exist on the same place where is today the 
                    main square of Bos en Lommer. It began in 1920 and 1930 among Admiraal de Ruijterkade, and consists mostly of apartment blocks and row housing.
                    The place was improvised as a tent camp after WWII. The areaâ€™s current redevelopment is trying to deal with the immigration gulfs and
                    increased traffic that the original plans did not anticipate, Bos en Lommer also receives national funding to improve infrastructure and general liveability.
                    The neighborhood is really nearby the center of Amsterdam but its own center is Bos en Lommerplein witch is the name of the main square of the neighborhood,
                    also there is an outdoor market on the square. There are a few parks nearby as well where it is perfect for a picnic or a barbeque when the sun is shining. The
                     neighborhood is family orientated and a multicultural population, rents are cheaper than the center of the city so that also attracts students to more in. 
                     Bos en Lommer has several restaurants as well where you can try different types of foods for different traditions.
